Hey,

We need a responsive web app UI designed from sketchd concept.This can be done on photoshop. We need just one page designed that is the size of a mobile screen. Once you design the mobile size screen then you will need the same idae designed for tablet and large screen. This will be a matter of adding space and increasing sizes etc. So you should be able to do it pretty easily within 30-40 min max. 

We have the concept sketched already. We now need some creative idea for the look and feel. 

If you know more about the project you can visit the following link:

Do you think you can do it? Please let us know.

cheers

Hey,

We need the attached image converted from PSD to HTML5 & CSS3. The design is done for mobile but we would also like some responsive versions for bigger screens. You will need to add some spaces and so on to make it work for larger screen. 

You need to be a CSS wizerd to be able to custom code the CSS with clean and structured CSS that is compatible with all different browsers.
